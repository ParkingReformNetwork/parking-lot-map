      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is included on this map?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The map includes surface parking and above ground parking structures
            which are marked on OpenStreetMap and/or visible in Google Maps
            imagery. It does not include street parking, underground parking,
            and podium parking (parking lots that take up only the first several
            floors of a building).
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What is the parking score?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The parking score measures how a city’s parking lot land use
            compares to other cities with similar metropolitan area populations.
          </p>
          <p>
            A low parking score is good and means that the city devotes less
            land in its central neighborhoods to parking than the average.
            Conversely, a high score means that more land is dedicated to
            parking compared to the average for a city of that size.
          </p>
          <p>
            This scoring system was created to evaluate cities on an equal basis
            and should not be used outside of this context.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What does “central city” mean?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            “Central city” is a term invented for this map to encompass the
            densest, most centrally located, and most valuable real estate in a
            metropolitan area. It is a blanket term for a city’s central
            business district, downtown, financial district, or adjacent
            connecting neighborhoods of interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, New Orleans’s Central Business District seamlessly
            connects with the World Renowned French Quarter Neighborhood. These
            areas were combined into the Central City of New Orleans.

        <dt>How do I embed this map in my site?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You can embed our map by using an iframe, which is a way to embed
            other websites directly into your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, find how to embed iframes with your website provider. For
            example, Wordpress sites should use a
            <a
              href="https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/custom-html-block/"
              >Custom HTML code block</a
            >. Try searching for the name of your website provider and 'iframe',
            like 'Squarespace iframe'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, include code like the following block. However, change the
            value for "src" to the link to your specific city, which you can get
            by clicking the link icon in the top-right corner of the map's
            header bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >&lt;iframe
              src="https://parkingreform.org/parking-lot-map/#parking-reform-map=salt-lake-city-ut"
              width="100%" height="525px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You may want to adjust the "width" and "height" attributes. However,
            we do not recommend setting the height taller than "525px" because
            it makes it hard to scroll on mobile.
