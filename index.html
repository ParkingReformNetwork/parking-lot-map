        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>What is the Parking Score?</dt>
          <dd>
            Parking Score measures how a city’s parking lot land use compares to
            other cities of a similar size. All red highlighted area on the map
            indicates an area where the land that’s primary purpose is parking
            passenger vehicles. A low parking score means the city devotes much
            less land in its central neighborhoods to parking than the average.
            Conversely, a high score translates to more land dedicated to
            parking compared to the average for a city of that size. This
            scoring system was created to evaluate cities on an equal basis and
            should not be used outside of this context.
          </dd>
          <dt>What is included on this map?</dt>
          <dd>
            This map generally includes surface parking and above ground parking
            structures which are marked on OpenStreetMap and/or visible in
            Google Maps imagery. It does not include underground or podium
            parking (parking lots that take up the first several floors of a
            building).
          </dd>
          <dt>What does “Central City” mean?</dt>
          <dd>
            “Central City” is a term invented for this map to encompass the
            densest, most centrally located, and most valuable real estate in a
            metropolitan area. “Central City” is a blanket term for a city’s
            Central Business District, Downtown, Financial District, or adjacent
            connecting neighborhoods of interest. For example, New Orleans’s
            Central Business District seamlessly connects with the World Renown
            French Quarter Neighborhood. These areas were combined into the
            Central City of New Orleans. For details on each city boundary
