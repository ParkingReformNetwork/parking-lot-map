      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is included on this map?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The map includes surface parking and above ground parking structures
            which are marked on OpenStreetMap and/or visible in Google Maps
            imagery. It does not include street parking, underground parking,
            and podium parking (parking lots that take up only the first several
            floors of a building).
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What is the parking score?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The parking score measures how a city’s parking lot land use
            compares to other cities with similar metropolitan area populations.
          </p>
          <p>
            A low parking score is good and means that the city devotes less
            land in its central neighborhoods to parking than the average.
            Conversely, a high score means that more land is dedicated to
            parking compared to the average for a city of that size.
          </p>
          <p>
            This scoring system was created to evaluate cities on an equal basis
            and should not be used outside of this context.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What does “central city” mean?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            “Central city” is a term invented for this map to encompass the
            densest, most centrally located, and most valuable real estate in a
            metropolitan area. It is a blanket term for a city’s central
            business district, downtown, financial district, or adjacent
            connecting neighborhoods of interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, New Orleans’s Central Business District seamlessly
            connects with the World Renowned French Quarter Neighborhood. These
            areas were combined into the Central City of New Orleans.

        <dt>How do I embed this map in my site?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You can embed our map by using an iframe, which is a way to embed
            other websites directly into your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, find how to embed iframes with your website provider. For
            example, Wordpress sites should use a
            <a
              href="https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/custom-html-block/"
              >Custom HTML code block</a
            >. Try searching for the name of your website provider and 'iframe',
            like 'Squarespace iframe'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, include code like the following block. However, change the
            value for 'src' to be your city's name and state.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >&lt;iframe
              src="https://parkingreform.org/parking-lot-map/#parking-reform-map=salt-lake-city-ut"
              width="100%" height="600px" &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; ></code
